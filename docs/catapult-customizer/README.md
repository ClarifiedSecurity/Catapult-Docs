# Catapult Customizer Example

This is an example [repo](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/catapult-customizer) to show how to Customize [Catapult](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/catapult) for your organization's or project's needs. To use this repo you need to create your own Git project (in a Git server of your choice) and then fill it out with the examples shown here. After that is done fill out `MAKEVAR_CATAPULT_CUSTOMIZER_REPO` in your Catapult's `.makerc-vars` file to include the customizations.

**DELETE ALL CUSTOMIZATION FOLDER AND FILE EXAMPLES THAT YOU WILL NOT BE USING** - Otherwise empty folder will be included overriding the default files.

The structure of the customization repo is as follows:

## Folders

- `certificates` - Contains the trusted certificate files that will be installed into the container. The certificate format must be `base64` and the file name format must be `<certificate_name>.crt`

- `container` - Contains .custom_aliases file that will be copied into the container. Refer to the [.default_aliases](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/Catapult/blob/main/container/home/builder/.default_aliases) file as an example on how to create .custom_aliases.

- `docker` - Contains custom docker-compose-extra.yml to add extra environment variables to the container. Refer to the default [docker-compose-extra.yml](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/Catapult/blob/main/defaults/docker-compose-extra.yml) for an example. Also contains docker-compose-personal.yml that will be created on first run. This file is used to store personal environment variables that you don't want to commit to the repo.

- `docker-entrypoints` - Contains custom docker-entrypoint scripts that will run inside the container during startup and `make shell`. Refer to default [entrypoint](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/Catapult/tree/main/scripts/entrypoints) scripts for examples.

- `makefiles` - Contains custom .makerc\* files specific to your organization or project. Refer to the default [.makerc](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/Catapult/blob/main/.makerc) file for examples and the [Makefile](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/Catapult/blob/main/Makefile#L3-L5) for different types of makefiles that get loaded if they exists.

- `poetry` - Contains custom pyroject.toml and poetry.lock files that will be used to install the Python dependencies when building your own image. Refer to the defaults [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/catapult/blob/main/defaults/pyproject.toml) for examples.

- `requirements` - Contains different \*.yml files that will be used to install the Ansible roles and collections. Refer to [Ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections_guide/collections_installing.html) or default [requirements](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/catapult/blob/main/defaults/requirements.yml) for how-to guide or examples.

- `scripts` - Contains custom scripts that will be used with the project.

- `start-tasks` - Contains scripts that will be run on the host during container startup. Refer to existing [start-tasks](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/Catapult/tree/main/scripts/start-tasks) for examples.

## Files

- `example.makerc-vars` - When using non-default `.makerc-vars` then make sure that `example.makerc-vars` is also defined in the Catapult Customizer repo because there are helper scripts that will check if your `.makerc-vars` contains all of the variables based on the `example.makerc-vars`.

- `start.yml` - In some rare cases you might want to customize the deployment tree of Catapult. For that you can create your own `start.yml` file and it will be used instead of the default one. Refer to the default [start.yml](https://github.com/ClarifiedSecurity/Catapult/blob/main/defaults/start.yml) as an example.
